This elephpant was originally intended for attendees at ZendCon 2014. It is based
on the [Apigility](https://apigility.org/) logo which shows a flying elephpant with
a rocket strapped to it's back. Because it was thought that the elephpant looked
like it was firing a rocket, the Z-Ray elephpant was designed and released instead.
Only the prototype of this design was created. It used a lighter color blue than
previous elephpants.
