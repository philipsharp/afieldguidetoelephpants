This elephpant was designed by the PHP Vegas user group. An [Indiegogo](https://igg.me/at/elephpant)
crowdfunding campaign was run produce it. However, it did not hit its funding target
and the prototype remains the only one of this subspecies in existence.

The name PHPlashy is an ode to the lights and glamor of Las Vegas, NV.
