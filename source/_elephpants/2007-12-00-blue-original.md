The original plush elephpant. At least six generations were produced over several
years by the French company Nexen, which became part of Alter Way.

The third photo shows the first elephpant ever produced. A prototype for the first
generation, it has the php logo in a different color. This elephpant is affectionately
known as <em>trisa√Øeul</em>.
