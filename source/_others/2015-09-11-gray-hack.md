Produced by the HHVM/Hack team at Facebook. It has not been released
publicly. It has a HHVM logo in place of the PHP logo. Three prototypes have
been produced followed by 500 which will not be available for sale.

The pHackyderm has several features that distinguish it from an elephpant including
an articulated trunk, robotic eye, and boots.

The first prototype is named Steve, the second Steph, and the third and final
Steven. All have the HHVM plate on the obverse side. The initial prototype has a
blank reverse, but the later protypes and production pHackyderms will have the
Hack logo and text on the reverse side.
