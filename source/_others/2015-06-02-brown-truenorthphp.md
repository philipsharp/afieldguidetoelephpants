This animal has smaller ears than an elephpant, and tusks. The body of the
mammoth consists of both plush fur and longer hair.

The woolly mammoth was produced as a giveaway for the 2015 [TrueNorth PHP Conference](http://truenorthphp.ca) in Toronto, Canada. A [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy) was held to help fund the giveaways.

Due to a production delay, the mammoths were not available in time for the conference and were instead distributed to TrueNorth PHP attendees primarily through meetups in and around Toronto. The mammoths were released and started shipping to Kickstarter backers in January 2016.
