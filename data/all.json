After developing the prototype the project was canceled because final production would not be ready in time. The single prototype was put up for auction on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/2015-golden-elePHPant-PHP-039-s-20th-birthday-1995-to-2015-\/321776947704\">Ebay<\/a> on the day of the anniversary. The auction was won by Zend Technologies co-founder Zeev Suraski.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the first elephpant that does not have plush fur. It has a circular disc on the right-rear leg showing the \"Official ElePHPant\" logo.<\/p>\n\n<p>This elephpant has its own Twitter account at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gelephpant\">@gelephpant<\/a>.<\/p>\n"
